      <h2>Baker Hot Springs:</h2>
      <p>
        Baker Hot Springs is a rustic geothermal spot nestled in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest of northern
        Washington. There is a small pool where hot water bubbles up at around 110°F. In certain spots within the pool,
        you might feel small rocks that are extremely hot to the touch. The smell may not be pleasant—it comes from the
        sulfur present in the water. Take a few minutes to relax and enjoy the experience, but avoid staying too long,
        as prolonged exposure could lead to dizziness or even heatstroke.
      </p>
      <h3>Some Tips</h3>
      <p>
        The road to Baker Hot Springs is rough with big potholes, so it is best to drive a truck or SUV. The hot springs
        are about a 30-minute hike from the parking area. Bring water, snacks, and a towel. It is also a good idea to
        bring a swimsuit or shorts, as you will want to get into the hot spring pool.
      </p>
      <h3> Getting There</h3>
      <p>
        To get to Baker Hot Springs, take Highway 542 east from Bellingham. Follow the signs to the Mount
        Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Once you enter the forest, look for signs directing you to the hot springs.
        The road can be rough, so drive carefully.

      <h2> Paradise at Mount Rainier:</h2>
      <p>
        Paradise at Mount Rainier is one of the most spectacular spots in the national park. It is located South side of
        Mount Rainier, about 30 minutes from the Nisqually Entrance. It offers a beautiful hiking trail called the
        Skyline Trail and known for its incredible views.</p>
      <h3>Some Tips</h3>
      <p>
        The best time to see stars at Paradise on Mount Rainier is from July to early September. The sky is usually
        clear, and there is little light,. Go when the moon is not bright (around the new moon) for the best view. Even
        in summer, it gets very cold at night, so wear warm clothes.

        I highly recommend hiking the Skyline Trail during the day. It takes about 4 hours to walk there and back. The
        trail starts steep and may feel hard at first, especially because of the high elevation, but it gets easier as
        you go. You will see amazing views of mountains, glaciers, and wildflowers. The path is well-marked and popular,
        but always stay on the trail and check the weather before you go.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting There</h3>
      <p>
        To get to Paradise at Mount Rainier, take Highway 706 east from Ashford. Follow the signs to the Paradise area.
        The road is well-maintained, but it can be busy during peak season, so plan accordingly.

      <h2>Lewis Falls Lower River:</h2>

        Lewis Falls is in southwest Washington, near Lake Merwin and Highway 14. It is about 15 miles east of Woodland.
        You can reach it from Old Lewis River Road. Lewis Falls is a small but pretty waterfall on the Lewis River in
        Washington. The water flows down over rocks into a pool below. It is not very high, but the water moves fast,
        especially in spring. Trees and moss grow around the falls, making it look green and peaceful. You can hear the
        water falling and birds in the trees. The trail to the falls is short and easy.
      </p>
